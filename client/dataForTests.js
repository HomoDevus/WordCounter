  'In January, Waldek celebrated his birthday. The party lasted three days, because you know how it is, oh look, your cousin came, and you’ve got some friends here, and your best friends there: there’s no way you could get them all together at once.\n' +

  'Waldek rents out one of his apartments, but not the whole thing, just a room for a couple złotys, on the condition that whenever he wants he can come, hang out, chat. Recently he rented the room to a fine young man who’d had a falling-out with his girlfriend. But the couple made up. No skin off Waldek’s nose since the young man had put down a deposit, it just didn’t work out. That wasn’t the first time anyway. Before that there’d been another straight boy: seductive, athletic. He’d bring girls home, but he was even sweet to Waldek. The first time it was all, “Stop, Waldek, what are you doing, quit fooling around,” but in the end, they slept together.'
