                <h2>‘Annette’ Review: Love Hurts</h2>
                <p>“Annette” is a musical about the ill-starred romance between two artists, a description that
                    suggests obvious kinship with “La La Land” and “A Star is Born.” Not to play algorithm or
                    anything, but if you liked those movies, you will probably like this one too.

                    Or maybe not. While it belongs, more or less, to the durable genre of backstage musical,
                    “Annette” aims to be something darker and stranger than another angsty melodrama about the
                    entanglements of ambition and love. It has some modern opera in its DNA — a lurid strand of
                    violence, madness and demonic passion that evokes pre-World War II Vienna or Berlin as much
                    as classic Hollywood. Rather than bursting into song or breaking into dance at opportune moments,
                    the characters stream their tormented consciousnesses through lyrics that are never as simple as
                    they sound.</p>
